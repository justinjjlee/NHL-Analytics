# Offensive zone positional successes

## Highlights

*	Stanley Cup-winning teams have very specific strategies in controlling puck possessions and goal-scoring positions in offensive zones
* Edmonton’s Zach Hyman trade may complement where Connor McDavid had challenges
* Maple Leaf’s struggle, even with two of the top scorers in the league, may be depending too much on those star players

## What I aim to observe

Observing play-level statistics from 2016-17 seasons to 2020-21 seasons, I provide descriptive understanding of average over (colored orange) and under (colored blue) shots-on-goal percentage of each players relative to the league average based on their position in offensive zone. See approach details on Methodology section.

## Anecdotal successful player positions and strategies
I observe three recent Stanley Cup-winning teams: Washington Capitals (2018), St. Louis Blues (2019), and Tampa Bay Lightning (2020 and 2021). Especially, the top forward lines for the teams have distinct approaches that helped them raise the cup. Table below notes players for the top lines.

### Top Forward lines for each team

| Teams | Line Combinations |
| --- | :---: | 
| Washington Capitals | Ovechkin - Kuznetsov/Backstrom - Wilson/Oshi |
| St. Louis Blues | Schenn-Schwartz-Tarasenko |
| Tampa Bay Lightening | Point-Palat-Kucherov |

### Capital's stay-in-your-lane approach
Capitals benefit from a reliable goal-scoring from distance, that is from Alex Ovechkin. In order to synergize, other forwards of the line has been narrowly positioned near the goal crease. This effectively generates blocks and benefits secondary opportunities.

### Kitchen-sink approach by St. Louis Blues
Blues in its 2018-2019 benefited from the top line's presence and scoring approach. With its scoring power, the line sinked its opposing goalies directly.

### Kucherov we trust
Lightening’s all-in-one approach has a mixture of both strategies mentioned above. Centered on its top scorer, Nikita Kucherov, Lightening manages to position its forwards to open up opportunities and follow through shots missed or blocked.
