# Sports Analytics - National Hockey League (NHL)

This repository contains data science toolkit codes to analyze National Hockey League (NHL) statistics. 

All of my analyses and deep-dive insights are written and presented in my medium blog [![Medium Blog Post](https://img.shields.io/badge/doc-latest-blue.svg)](https://medium.com/@thinkingjustin). There, I also include narratives on visualizations created by codes saved in this repository.

This is a selection of many ways to collect, compile, clean, analyze, model, and predict team and player (skaters and goalies) performances statistics. This repository does not claim any ownership of data and represents points of views of organizations or representations mentioned. All original codes (including generic and model algorithms) can be used freely with a proper citation to this repository.

## API Source change (2024)
NHL has changed its API and data structure, and I am working to complete the API pull and data processing workflows.
All previous analysis and methods are valid, but the columns are valid through the past data pulled through `statsapi` which I locally have.
