# Sequencing of player activities - blocking shots
Work related to analyzing sequence of data, particularly on blocking shots and how those subsequent activities impact subsequent activities

## Data & Measurements
These are data points and sequencial measurements that I caputre for this analysis
- [x] All shot types and outcomes
- [x] Team/players involved: shooter and blocker
- [x] Team posture and sequence of the shooting: before and after the blocked shots
- [x] Sequencial events in number of players: full strength or `power play`/`penalty kill`
- [x] Team posture and shifts after blocked shots

## Analysis
The complete analysis with narration is saved in my Medium page.
